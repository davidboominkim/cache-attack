Hello, Ed
Please, read this letter very attentively.  Today, as I have already noticed we have a lot of work to do: 1) Receive your material. 2) Make our first payment to you.  As you understand everything is prearranged and done with the utmost security.  The only thing for you to do is to act as quickly and accurately as possible.  So, please, strictly follow the instruction below and it will be as easy as A, B, C.

A. After reading this letter, scrutinizing map, pictures and sketches (Enclosed.  Your routes are shown in green and places of operations in red.)  Proceed Garden State Pkwy (northbound).  Take exit 131A and keeping always right enter the parking lot in front of the "METROPARK STATION".

B. Park your car as shown in picture#1 and go to the EASTBOUND PLATFORM of the station.  At the east end of the platform there is a wooden stair.  Descending this stair drop your pack (with material) on the ground near the wooden pole of the stair.  (See picture #2.)  After that go to your car and immediately leave this area.  Your material will be picked up by us just in seconds.

C. Again take Garden Satte pkwy (northbound).  Within 2 miles from exit 131A enter the service station (gas, telephone).  By all means park your car right behind TEXACO station as shown in oval "C" at the map.  There are 2 public phones outside the Texaco station.  Wait here for my call.  I call you at 2:45p.m. and then (in case you are late) at 3p.m., 3:15p.pm., 3:30p.m..  Here you'll get further instructions to our next procedure.

Good luck,
Jim
